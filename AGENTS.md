# Agent Instructions — Sean Ali Company

## Mandatory page design and mobile skim contract (ACTIVE — 2026-10-17)

**Canonical SOP:** https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b8spvfawckoTRZukEsXY2K8mV8swWJR2FQfT7-Qi2CM/edit

For ANY new or revised public-facing page (landing, sales, product, opt-in, thank-you, homepage, help article, visual funnel section, or promotional UI), this is the default **visual / UX** layer. Apply with the company's active SOP router, current offer/page-specific SOP and verified live product/checkout facts. A user's latest explicit request has priority. If the Google Doc is unavailable, the self-contained rules here still apply. This is NOT a standing request to redesign current pages.

### Hard rules — do not wait for the user to repeat them

1. **One centered main content column** on mobile, tablet and desktop for reading, product and purchase flows. Do NOT invent a two-column text/image hero or side-by-side reading columns. Keep any full-width background band's CONTENT constrained and centered. Exceptions only for necessary functional app dashboards, tables, navigation or a specifically approved/tested page control.
2. **Readable type, not tiny dense copy.** Target mobile H1 36–44px; H2 28–34px; body 18–20px; primary button text 17–20px; comfortable body line-height ~1.5–1.65. Use responsive clamp() appropriately. Reserve 14–16px for incidental metadata, not essential information or payment terms. Avoid more than 2–3 conspicuous type sizes in a block.
3. **Restrict long lines.** Center content container around max-width 840–920px, but keep actual reading text max-width roughly 600–680px. On 320–430px phones leave ~20–24px side gutters when practical (16px minimum). Keep copy in short mobile-skimmable paragraphs, ideally 1–3 sentences and no dense text walls. Never silently rewrite approved copy when asked only to change presentation; instead fix line breaks, spacing, width and hierarchy.
4. **Strong section separation.** Default mobile section vertical spacing 56–72px; desktop 80–112px. Give cards ~20–28px internal padding. Separate major sections with ample whitespace OR a subtle background change OR a restrained divider—not excessive decoration. Do not leave giant dead gaps above the fold.
5. **SHOW rather than explain.** First use verified actual product/media assets already in the repository (real covers, bundle art, phone/preview image, app screenshot, working audio sample, genuine proof). Add meaningful icon-led steps/cards only when they improve comprehension. Never substitute a different product's artwork or generate generic mockups when the authentic product exists.
6. **One clear hero and primary CTA.** Compact legitimate promo strip if relevant, short H1 and one supporting sentence, clearly visible offer/price, conspicuous primary CTA and real visual. Mobile CTA comes before an oversized product image where the active page control requires that. Keep equivalent buying buttons visually consistent with existing brand's verified CTA color/component; free demos remain secondary. Do not invent competing plans or add a sticky CTA/modal by default.
7. **Modern but trustworthy.** Shopify-like purchasing clarity + modern SaaS/Lovable-like polish: consistent clean sans-serif typography, restrained brand palette, rounded cards, real product visual, no piles of gradients, competing colors, icon spam, cheezy motion, glassmorphism or tiny gray copy. The ACTUAL brand's current design wins over any historical generic black/purple/gold mandate.
8. **Truth and working paths.** Confirm exact offer, included items, real component values, current price/currency, authenticated proof, product-specific claims, checkout links, active promotions and fulfillment. Never invent ratings, scarcity, expired countdowns, customer activity, scientific certainty, guaranteed wealth, or before/after results. Preserve approved copy, existing pixels/GA4, UTMs, forms, payment routing, audio, SEO and consent controls unless the task explicitly changes them.
9. **Inspect before and after.** Read current repo code, site assets, shared styling and any production injection/Worker code before editing. Use the smallest scoped change. Test the *rendered* page at 320×568, 375×667, 390×844, 430px mobile, 768px tablet and desktop; fix clipping, overflow, unreadable text, weird heading wrapping, sticky overlap, inaccessible popups and wrong images. Click actual CTA, audio, and modal flows; check build/lint where applicable. Verify the final live deployed page before claiming 'pushed live'. A git commit alone is not live verification.


### REQUIRED on public hub homepages: moving hero benefit slider (2026-10-17)

**HUBS, NOT FUNNELS.** On every new or revised **public brand / discovery hub homepage**, the hero MUST include a visibly moving, horizontal, looping **benefit slider / marquee with meaningful icons or emojis** and short phrases. This is a high-priority visual identity rule: public hubs should feel alive, not static. It applies to main public hubs such as Hypnotic Meditations, SeanAli.online, Manifestation Genie and other branded discovery homepages, regardless of repo. Determine page type by its purpose, **not** the repository name.

**Never add by default to focused sales funnels**, VSL pages, opt-ins, checkout/upsell/thank-you flows, SKU product landing pages, support articles, editorial posts or internal dashboards. Do not disturb an existing controlled sales page simply to add motion. A homepage that is an actual focused direct-product funnel follows its page-specific control unless Sean explicitly requests hub-style motion.

**Placement:** inside the hero or directly under its primary content, while preserving the centered single-column reading layout, oversized readable headline, main real product visual and clear primary CTA. Do not let the marquee push the CTA off-screen or become the headline.

**Content:** ~4–8 unique truthful icon/emoji + benefit items, ~2–6 words each, reflecting the specific hub (e.g. 🎧 Premium guided audio · ✨ Daily rituals · 📱 Listen on your phone · 🧘 Relax and reset, only where accurate). Use existing authentic assets/style. Avoid fake live viewer/order notices, inflated claims, filler emojis or offers that are not available.

**Motion:** lightweight smooth seamless horizontally moving CSS ticker/marquee; default around 20–35 seconds per full cycle, adjusted for actual width/readability. Continuous but calm, no jumping on loop, flashing, excessive animations or performance-heavy libraries. High-contrast 16–18px+ labels on mobile; enough gap between icons/pills. Visually clip the slider band to prevent full-page horizontal scroll.

**Accessibility:** `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` must show a static/user-scrollable row. Pause motion on hover/focus when feasible. Support responsive 320/375/390/430px phones and desktop. Do not duplicate items for screen-reader output when duplicating them for an infinite loop, and do not hide essential one-time content only within animation.

**QA gate:** For a public hub homepage edit, inspect the actual rendered hero: slider present, clearly moving under normal motion, smooth and legible, real truthful benefits, brand-consistent, no horizontal overflow or CTA obstruction, functional reduced-motion. If missing/broken on a hub, FAIL and repair before saying done. On a funnel, adding it without specific approval is itself a FAIL. Updating AGENTS.md alone does not authorize mass redesign or site deployment.

### Mandatory pass/fail at completion

Before declaring a page task done, check: (a) centered one-column reading flow; (b) comfortable mobile text and short lines; (c) distinct visual section boundaries; (d) real assets/icons/demo instead of unnecessary prose; (e) clean headline → product → CTA hierarchy; (f) truthful price/proof/contents; (g) correct working forms/checkout/media; (h) no broken tracking; (i) rendered screenshots at phone + desktop sizes; (j) live production confirmation or an explicit statement that deployment was NOT verified. If a check fails, fix it or state exactly what remains.

**Precedence:** Specific verified product/funnel behavior and the user's explicit latest instructions > this visual system > obsolete generic layout/color defaults. This UX SOP does NOT override editorial voice, security, backend behavior, checkout design already measured as a control, or legal disclosures. For 'layout only' requests, preserve wording. For normal website tasks, do not change code unless asked, and do not alter production without verification.

**This repo primarily runs backend/operations:** apply visual standards ONLY when generating or editing customer-facing web/UI content. Do not introduce web layouts, new page requirements, or cosmetic code into services, automations, pipelines or reports.


## MCP-specific current operating context (2026-10-20)

This repository is a public codebase and a dated catalog, not a live CRM or checkout. User's latest explicit instruction wins. Open the active SOP router before material business decisions: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-V1YwoP_Dyxor8g1kvElVlNLrYLwJ7zG2wnj6Rc2n4k/edit and active index: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tVYf6SXyYyitouhHVh55_KJXPcijMVITPxnkLvZVKDU/edit

For offer changes, read the October 18 offer/bundle SOP: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iwJEBP4s7HHpjZc0HaWYhUn8p0RtVduDgKsqEbX2yf4/edit and sales/Meta SOP: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gv-HxkQCXTNUs1DDA4acQmxdgc0CCCgNrXqwimJXTeI/edit.

Private personalized audio production: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EncD69lYMfKlLRh1dMPkSl6XAB9jdsIGXhbCXn-D3yE/edit.

Main acquisition priority is qualified traffic to Money Flow, with the Ariella $8 test kept distinct. Daily traffic levers: paid ads, organic CTA content, relevant email/DM. Optimize verified orders and profit per qualified visitor, not just building assets. The $67 Money Mind Stack is a different checkout from the $8 Starter Kit; confirm premium delivery inventory. Respond.io is the conversation CRM; payment providers establish purchases; AWeber tags alone do not. Do not expose buyer PII or private audio, publish unsupported scientific or wealth claims, or claim real-time price updates without verification.

Public HTTP must never expose local operator tools. Protect remote HTTP with a server-side secret; no secrets in this repo. Run tests and verify an actual deployment URL before announcing a live release. Static SOP pointers do not authorize changing payment, pages, campaigns, messages or customer fulfillment.
